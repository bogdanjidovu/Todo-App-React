# TODO App - React

A "To Do" application used to store daily todo lists, ideas or grocery lists.
This app was built because I am a huge fan of "To Do" apps as I use one daily in order to organise my work for the day and to store my ideas. It is a prototype for now as I am gonna improve this application in my free time.
The app is built in ReactJS.
